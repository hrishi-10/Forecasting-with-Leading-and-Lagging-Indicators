# Forecasting with Leading and Lagging Indicators

The project explores the use of leading and lagging indicators in forecasting, with a focus on their application in economics and business decision-making.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Forecasting is crucial for strategic planning in both public and private sectors. This project investigates how **leading** and **lagging** indicators are used to predict and assess economic and business trends. Through real-world examples, SWOT analysis, and a structured forecasting methodology, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of how these indicators support accurate and actionable forecasts.

## ðŸ§  Key Topics Covered

- Definition and distinction between leading and lagging indicators
- Historical origins and evolution of usage
- Applications in economics, financial markets, and business strategy
- Case studies including Amazon, Tesla, Google, and Goldman Sachs
- Step-by-step methodology for incorporating indicators into forecasting models
- SWOT analysis of both indicator types
- Real-life examples: Yield curve, unemployment, GDP

## âœ… Learning Outcomes

Through the completion of this group project on **Leading and Lagging Indicators in Forecasting**, we developed the following knowledge and skills:

### ðŸ“˜ Conceptual Understanding
- Gained a clear understanding of the definitions and distinctions between **leading** and **lagging indicators**.
- Learned how these indicators are used in **economic forecasting**, **business decision-making**, and **market analysis**.
- Explored historical development and modern applications of composite indices like the **Conference Boardâ€™s Leading Economic Index (LEI)**.

### ðŸ“Š Analytical Skills
- Developed a step-by-step framework to incorporate indicators into forecasting workflows using statistical tools like:
  - **Granger Causality Tests**
  - **Principal Component Analysis**
  - **ACF/PACF analysis**
- Understood the relevance of **validation metrics** like RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and **Diebold-Mariano tests** for model comparison.

### ðŸ”Ž Research & Evaluation
- Conducted SWOT analyses for both indicator types to critically evaluate their strengths and limitations in forecasting contexts.
- Studied multiple real-life examples (Amazon, Google, GDP trends, yield curve inversions, etc.) to ground theory in practice.
