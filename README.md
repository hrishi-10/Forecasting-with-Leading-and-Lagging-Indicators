# Forecasting with Leading and Lagging Indicators

This repository contains a group project submitted as part of the IB98E0 Forecasting module in the MSc Business Analytics programme at the University of Warwick (2024–2025). The project explores the use of leading and lagging indicators in forecasting, with a focus on their application in economics and business decision-making.

## 📊 Project Overview

Forecasting is crucial for strategic planning in both public and private sectors. This project investigates how **leading** and **lagging** indicators are used to predict and assess economic and business trends. Through real-world examples, SWOT analysis, and a structured forecasting methodology, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of how these indicators support accurate and actionable forecasts.

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered

- Definition and distinction between leading and lagging indicators
- Historical origins and evolution of usage
- Applications in economics, financial markets, and business strategy
- Case studies including Amazon, Tesla, Google, and Goldman Sachs
- Step-by-step methodology for incorporating indicators into forecasting models
- SWOT analysis of both indicator types
- Real-life examples: Yield curve, unemployment, GDP

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

Through the completion of this group project on **Leading and Lagging Indicators in Forecasting**, we developed the following knowledge and skills:

### 📘 Conceptual Understanding
- Gained a clear understanding of the definitions and distinctions between **leading** and **lagging indicators**.
- Learned how these indicators are used in **economic forecasting**, **business decision-making**, and **market analysis**.
- Explored historical development and modern applications of composite indices like the **Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI)**.

### 📊 Analytical Skills
- Developed a step-by-step framework to incorporate indicators into forecasting workflows using statistical tools like:
  - **Granger Causality Tests**
  - **Principal Component Analysis**
  - **ACF/PACF analysis**
- Understood the relevance of **validation metrics** like RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and **Diebold-Mariano tests** for model comparison.

### 🔎 Research & Evaluation
- Conducted SWOT analyses for both indicator types to critically evaluate their strengths and limitations in forecasting contexts.
- Studied multiple real-life examples (Amazon, Google, GDP trends, yield curve inversions, etc.) to ground theory in practice.
